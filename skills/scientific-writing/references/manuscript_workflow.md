# Evidence-backed manuscript workflow

Read the sections relevant to the requested workflow. Paths and command examples
are relative to the skill directory unless stated otherwise.

## Intake

Before drafting, obtain or mark unresolved:

- document type, study design, stage, audience, and target venue;
- current author instructions and policy access date;
- protocol, registration, analysis plan, amendments, and reporting guideline;
- manuscript or section scope;
- verified source manifest and claim registry;
- methods, results, tables, figures, and supplements;
- authorship, CRediT, declarations, and approval records;
- confidentiality classification and authorized processing boundary;
- data, code, materials, and repository constraints.

Do not ask for restricted source material if metadata or a local user-run audit is
sufficient.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish the local workspace

For a new draft, optionally generate fail-closed Markdown, JSON, and CSV scaffolds:

```bash
python3 scripts/scaffold_manuscript.py \
  --output-dir ./draft-workspace \
  --document-id local-draft \
  --study-design randomized_trial \
  --guideline consort-2025
```

The generator never overwrites files. Its output is explicitly not submission-ready and
contains placeholders that the linter rejects.

### 2. Select reporting guidance

Choose by actual design and article type, then open the current official statement,
checklist, explanation document, extensions, and target-journal instructions.

```bash
python3 scripts/select_reporting_guidelines.py select \
  --study-design randomized_trial
```

Current major routes researched on 2026-07-24 include CONSORT 2025, SPIRIT 2025,
PRISMA 2020, STROBE, STARD and STARD-AI, TRIPOD+AI, CARE, ARRIVE 2.0, SQUIRE 2.0,
and CHEERS 2022 [SW-S06–SW-S18].

The selector is non-scoring. It does not certify quality, compliance, completeness, or
acceptance. See `references/reporting_guidelines.md`.

### 3. Build the evidence record

Assign:

- `E` IDs to sources in `source_manifest.json`;
- `C` IDs to claims in `claims.csv`;
- `N`, `M`, `O`, and `R` IDs to numeric facts, methods, outcomes, and results in
  `consistency_manifest.json`.

Store a hash of claim text in CSV rather than raw claim text. During drafting, append:

```text
[claim:C001] [evidence:E001,E002]
```

Do not mark a source verified until an accountable human has opened it and confirmed
the exact support.

### 4. Create an evidence outline

Outline only from recorded evidence:

- objective or question;
- section purpose;
- claim IDs and evidence IDs;
- methods and result IDs;
- analysis intent and uncertainty;
- unresolved conflicts or missing information;
- applicable reporting topics.

Keep unsupported content in an unresolved-issues list, not manuscript prose.

### 5. Draft without adding facts

Transform the verified outline into venue-appropriate prose. Preserve all IDs during
drafting.

- Match title and abstract to the completed main text.
- Describe methods as performed.
- Present results in the declared order and analysis population.
- Separate result from interpretation unless the venue combines them.
- Compare with prior evidence only after verifying it.
- Keep conclusions within the observed design, population, and uncertainty.

Use IMRAD only when appropriate. Structured abstracts, lists, combined sections, and
alternative structures depend on study design and venue. See
`references/imrad_structure.md` and `references/writing_principles.md`.

### 6. Reconcile methods and results

Record repeated numeric facts and method-result mappings, then run:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_consistency.py consistency_manifest.json
```

Resolve every mismatch manually. A changed value may be a legitimate analysis-set
difference, but that difference must be named rather than silently normalized.

### 7. Verify citations and claims

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_manifest.py source_manifest.json \
  --kind source --require-verified
python3 scripts/audit_claims.py manuscript.md claims.csv source_manifest.json
python3 scripts/check_references.py source_manifest.json
```

The reference checker validates syntax and duplicate identifiers without network
resolution. A human must still compare every identifier and quotation with the opened
source. Follow NLM *Citing Medicine* or the current official style required by the
venue [SW-S20, SW-S21].

### 8. Validate authorship and disclosure

Use journal criteria for authorship. Record the standardized CRediT roles as
contribution metadata; CRediT does not itself define authorship [SW-S19].

If AI was used, humans must verify all affected content and disclose the tool and
purpose according to current journal and publisher policy. ICMJE's January 2026
Recommendations require transparency and retain human accountability [SW-S01, SW-S02].

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_authorship.py authorship.json
```

Do not generate a disclosure from assumptions. See
`references/authorship_ai_confidentiality.md`.

### 9. Review declarations and open-science statements

Verify each statement independently:

- ethics and consent;
- registration and protocol;
- funding and sponsor role;
- conflicts and relationships;
- author contributions and acknowledgments;
- data, code, materials, and protocol availability;
- AI use.

Be as open as rights and responsibilities permit, but do not expose confidential,
personal, proprietary, licensed, or protected information. Record actual access
conditions. See `references/research_integrity_open_science.md`.

### 10. Use figures and tables only when warranted

Figures and tables are optional and provenance-bound. This skill does not generate
images or schematics.

For every retained display:

- link source data, code, transformations, and evidence IDs;
- reconcile values with prose and registries;
- document image processing, permissions, and licenses;
- include units, denominators, sample sizes, uncertainty, and analysis population;
- provide alt text and redundant non-color cues;
- perform a manual accessibility and scientific check at final size.

See `references/figures_tables.md`.

### 11. Record non-scoring guideline coverage

Record each bundled high-level topic as addressed, not applicable with rationale, or
missing:

```bash
python3 scripts/select_reporting_guidelines.py check reporting_coverage.json
```

Then complete the official checklist using actual manuscript locations. Never claim
adherence merely because the local coverage file passes.

### 12. Lint and approve

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_manifest.py manuscript_manifest.json --kind manuscript
python3 scripts/lint_manuscript.py manuscript.md \
  --manifest manuscript_manifest.json
```

The linter reports issue codes and line numbers without echoing manuscript text.
Sensitive-content warnings require manual review and are not a de-identification
certificate.

Only accountable humans may:

- resolve scientific ambiguities;
- approve author order and declarations;
- approve external disclosure or transfer;
- set `submission_ready` to true;
- remove the draft banner;
- authorize submission.
